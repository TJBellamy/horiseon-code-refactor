# Code Refactor

## Description
As a developer I've been tasked with refactoring and optimizing the code for a fictional digital marketing agency called Horiseon.
While reveiwing the code I found multple broken links, missing alt texts on images for accessibility reasons, and illogical semantic structure.
I was able to successfully able to correct these errors, complete all of my initial tasks, and restore all funcionality to the website.
